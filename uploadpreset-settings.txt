# Cloudinary Upload Preset Settings for Proper Folder Structure

For images to appear in the correct folders in the Cloudinary Media Library, you need to configure your upload preset with these settings:

1. Go to your Cloudinary Dashboard > Settings > Upload
2. Find your upload preset "quickshop_images" or create a new one
3. Configure these settings:

## Essential Settings:
- **Asset folder**: Leave empty or set to "quickshop/"
- **Use folder**: Enable this option
- **Generated public ID**: Select "Use the filename of the uploaded file as the public ID"
- **Prepend a path to the public ID**: Leave empty (we'll handle this in code)

## Additional Recommendations:
- **Unique filenames**: Enable to avoid overwriting
- **Resource Type**: Set to "Auto" or "Image"
- **Access Mode**: "public" for website images

## Important Notes:
1. Our code sends the folder path (e.g., "quickshop/products") with each upload
2. The images have the correct path in the URL and public_id
3. Cloudinary's Media Library might display folders differently than the actual path structure
4. You can organize files in the Media Library by using the "folder" parameter during upload

Even if the folders don't appear correctly in the Media Library, the images are still being stored with the correct path structure in their public_ids.
